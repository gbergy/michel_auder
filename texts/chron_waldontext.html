        <p class="orange">Louis Waldon in Chronicles:<br>
          Los Angeles/Bel-Air (July 1999)<br>
          2002, 42 minutes</p>
        <p class="blacktext">This chapter of the Chronicles is in many respects 
          a sequel to the portrait of his good friend and former Warhol actor 
          Louis Waldon. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">It is also a clich&eacute; of the good life served-up 
          Los Angeles style &#150; the sun, the implants, and the traffic. Waldon 
          invited Auder to spend a few days at the home/compound of his wealthy 
          friend Don. The situation recalls Waldon and Auder's first meeting in 
          Rome thirty years prior as documented in Auder's earlies surviving work, 
          the film Keeping Busy. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">Neither Waldon nor Auder (recently divorced from 
          his second wife, Cindy Sherman) has lost his penchant for shooting the 
          breeze. This time they find themselves in the lap of luxury with the 
          same estranged relationship to the good life, i.e. forever outside looking 
          in albeit from close-up. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">In this instance, Auder uses a shiny black Mercedes 
          with fallen blossoms from surrounding flora scattered on its hood as 
          a means to construck a stunning vanitas. Since Auder's 1994 video portrait, 
          Waldon has some new wrinkles and has gained more weight but these do 
          not reflect age as much as an increase in his charms which are in full 
          effect throughout. (He gives a poolside performance not to be believed.)<br>
