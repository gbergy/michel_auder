        <p class="orange">My Last Bag of Heroin (For Real)<br>
          1986, 4 minutes</p>
        <p>&#148;You know you're addicted to heroin when you begin proclaiming 
          every bag to be your last.&#148; Auder says this from experience. Throughout 
          the early and mid 1980s he was an addict. In this candid piece of disclosure 
          he demonstrates a method of smoking heroin referred to as Chasing the 
          Dragon. Drumming his fingers on the table-top while waiting for the 
          high to take effect, heroin use is depicted as a boredom far from bliss. 
          The work ends with Auder in a druginduced stupor, delivering a rambling 
          proclamation about kicking the habit, &#148;good-bye dope, good bye 
          monkey.&#148; </p>
        <p>The title's parenthetical (For Real), however, does not refer to the 
          fact that Auder actually made good on his proclamation. As Auder stated 
          &#148;I would have said those words regardless of whether or not I quit 
          because addicts delude themselves. In My Last Bag, I am only saying 
          what I had said so many times before.&#148; And by default, what he 
          potentially could have said so many times after having made the video. 
        </p>
        <p>The work's &#148;Real&#148; lesson is that confession no matter how 
          earnest should not be confused with truth.</p>
