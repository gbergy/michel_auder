        <p class="orange">Flying<br>
          1983, 4 minutes</p>
        <p>Auder uses airplane flight to explore the relationship between the 
          imaginary, the symbolic and the real. The piece consists of imagery 
          appropriated from television and footage Auder recorded firsthand. The 
          boundary between his sources, however, is hopelessly blurred through 
          the use of re-recorded imagery that is rapidly interspersed throughout 
          the piece. </p>
        <p>It is not a question of fact versus fiction (the real versus the imaginary) 
          but the extent to which our experiences are mediated through degrees 
          of fantasy in a more general sense. Footage of a young boy is poignantly 
          contrasted with that of a young male pilot seated in the cockpit of 
          a small aircraft. Through the aid of a toy plane, the boy enacts maneuvers 
          the pilot will likely undergo in reality. </p>
        <p>This pairing is then disrupted by images of flight taken from television. 
          The result is a rapidly alternating discourse between childhood fantasy, 
          adulthood reality out of which emerges a more real uncertainty.
