        <p class="orange">Brooding Angels, Made for R.L.<br>
          1988, 6 minutes</p>
        <p>From its fiery outset, Brooding Angles is decidedly gothic and the 
          mood anxious. It is a dark rumination on the specter of authority, resistance 
          and paranoia marking the close of Reagan's second term in office. </p>
        <p>Born in 1945, Auder came of age during the 1960s, a decade as tumultuous 
          in France as it was in the United States. The decade culminated in the 
          student/worker strikes of May 1968 that shut down the city of Paris. 
          Auder's value system was in many respects shaped by this anti-authoritarian 
          milieu. </p>
        <p>Its remnants are to be found in his preponderance with issues violence 
          and conflict as they serve to question moral progress. The soundtrack's 
          ominous melody is recycled from footage of cellist David Soyer that 
          can be seen in A Portrait of Alice Neel.</p>
