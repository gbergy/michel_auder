          From tales of the life of Michel 
          Auder as told to Jeremy Blake, October 14 and 15, 2000</strong></p>
         
          
          <p class="blacktext"><strong>Q</strong> Where were you born?<br>
          <strong>M</strong>ichel <strong>A</strong>uder I was born in 1944 in 
          the north of France in a small, industrial town &#8211; it&#8217;s called 
          Soissons. When people ask about France they usually ask if you&acute;re 
          from Paris, or from the south, because they don&#8217;t know the north 
          &#8211; or because they know that you don&#8217;t want to go where I 
          was born. People who know the place usually act like, like I was a coal 
          miner&acute;s uh, a coal miner&acute;s daughter or something like this. 
          But we left Soissons when I was four years old, and I was raised mostly 
          in a small, almost medieval town about an hour and a half south of Paris.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> What are the strongest impressions you have from 
          your childhood?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> I was fairly alone, all the time. Our house was 
          basically in the woods. My backyard was like, one of Louie XIV&#8217;s 
          hunting grounds &#8211; and it was pretty much just as he left it. My 
          father had rented a house that was much more extravagant than he could 
          afford, and he was never there. We found out later that he had another 
          family in some other town.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> When did you find out about the other family?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> My first wife Viva, she found out from my sister 
          when we visited her in Paris. I was probably twenty-eight by then. Both 
          my parents were very nice, you know, just not always around. I wasn&#8217;t 
          abandoned or anything like this. My mother was very sweet, but she was 
          often in Paris. My older sister married when I was eight, and moved 
          away. I walked twenty, twenty-five minutes to school by myself.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Somehow I don&acute;t imagine you as a model student.<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> (Laughs) Well, I didn&#8217;t have friends and I 
          couldn&#8217;t really get along at school. My parents couldn&#8217;t 
          really do anything to help me. The problem with the schooling I had 
          was that it was very old fashioned. I don&#8217;t think it had been 
          updated since the revolution. It was all memorization, and I didn&#8217;t 
          do well with that. In fact, I was usually last in my class. But I was 
          very quiet. I wasn&#8217;t making trouble, you know, physically. I wasn&#8217;t 
          a nuisance.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> So your schooling was too conservative for you. Were 
          your parents powerless to help you because they were too old fashioned 
          as well?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Not really. Actually my father was a Communist. 
          Not a party member, but very left wing for his own reasons. He worked 
          as an engineer, but he never paid his taxes, so he always got fucked 
          in the end by the government. They would come by every few years and 
          take all his money. That&#8217;s probably where I got the idea to go 
          to America. From him, but indirectly. Because he was always going on 
          about Russia.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Did you watch television or go to the movies?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> No. Never. We didn&#8217;t even have a phone. When 
          I got out of school each day I went into the woods, and started, you 
          know, dreaming about things. But I didn&#8217;t do my homework of course.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> So you had no early exposure to film at all? What 
          about photography?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> My father had an old Rolleiflex in the house and 
          that kind of fascinated me but I wasn&#8217;t sure why. I didn&#8217;t 
          really see movies until I went to Paris. We got thrown out the house 
          the same year I finished school, when I was like, sixteen or something. 
          This was in, you know, &#8217;60. My father hadn&#8217;t paid the rent 
          in a couple of years. So I went to Paris after that, and I began to 
          watch films. But really I started as a photographer. When I got to Paris 
          a friend of my sister said, &#8221;You know Michel, you really should 
          do something.&#8221; The only thing I could think of to do that I liked 
          was to use the camera.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> So you went to work as a commercial photographer?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Yes, I started as an apprentice, and discovered 
          that I was very good. I worked very fast and I could basically see in 
          the dark. I opened my own studio around &#8217;63 and I started to do 
          very well shooting fashion. I took my first trip to the States to work 
          with Hiro on a job for Harper&#8217;s Bazaar. I loved New York. I had 
          a fifteen-day visa, but I ended up staying for five months. I went to 
          the Fat Black Pussycat every night, you know, and I saw Taylor Mead 
          there for the first time.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Were you and Taylor introduced at that point?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> No, but I recognized him when I met him later because 
          Taylor is so fucking weird that you remember it all your life. Anyway, 
          after five months finally I went to immigration and said, &#8221;I love 
          this country and I want to stay.&#8221; They said, &#8221;Great! Fantastic!&#8221; 
          and then they sent me directly to jail. I was in the jail for immigrants 
          down on Broadway. In a few weeks they put me on a boat back to France. 
          As soon as I got back to Paris I found out that I had been drafted to 
          go fight in Algeria. Of course the government came after the dropouts 
          and the poor kids first. I lost the lease on my studio, my apartment, 
          everything.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Wait &#8211; you fought in Algeria?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Not exactly. When I was drafted I was off working 
          in the States. Because I didn&#8217;t show up, they put an order out 
          for my arrest. My mother notified them when I got back &#8211; she was 
          worried they would hunt me all my life otherwise&#8230; They were going 
          to send me off to fight, but at that time my mother&#8217;s lover was 
          the bodyguard of the minister of the entire French Army. He stepped 
          in and had my orders changed so that I was in the photo and film division. 
          It was a very good assignment because you stayed in Paris and got to 
          go home at night. The unit was basically full of rich kids &#8211; well-educated 
          people. These rich motherfuckers were pulling up to the fort in their 
          Jaguars and shit like that. The only thing is that you had to be there 
          every morning at 6 am. Of course I could never be bothered to show up 
          on time. It was a good enough assignment for everyone else, but not 
          good enough for me. They threw me in jail few times, and finally when 
          they&#8217;d had enough of me they sent me to Algeria.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> They sent you into combat as punishment?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> As a combat photographer, yes. But the idea was 
          basically to get me killed. This was in &#8217;63, during the last big 
          fight for independence, and you had no business there unless you were 
          there to shoot someone.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Were you politically against the war, or did you 
          just hate the army?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Both. I was not a Communist but I was very left 
          wing, very much against the war, and I was seriously disturbed about 
          the way I was drafted. I began to hate De Gualle and blame him personally 
          for all of these problems. I tried to make a statement by never changing 
          my clothes &#8211; I wore the dirtiest shirt I could stand &#8211; I 
          had long hair, and I refused to do anything that I was asked to do. 
          Very shortly after I got to Algeria, I was thrown in jail for visiting 
          a whorehouse. I didn&#8217;t mind because jail was the safest place 
          in the country at that point. The whole country was a bloody mess, and 
          there was deep conflict in the French army about whether or not the 
          war should continue. After three months in jail some general looked 
          at my case and said, &#8221;What the fuck is that crazy long-haired 
          guy doing down here anyway? Send him back to France!&#8221;.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> So you didn&#8217;t end up shooting any film during 
          your stint in the army?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> No.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> When did you make your first film?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> I saw some movies by Roger Vadim when I moved to 
          Paris, and some other, you know, French guy kind of films. I hated American 
          films. French films at that time were extremely sexy, and I started 
          to get the idea that maybe fashion photography wasn&#8217;t enough for 
          me. I refused to do anything in the army as I said &#8211; but after 
          I got out I met a woman who gave me the money to make my first film. 
          I can&acute;t remember her name.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Are you sure you can&#8217;t remember?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Not right now. But I got a script from some writer 
          she knew called Anne Evad&eacute;es Des Saisons. Anne was played by 
          a woman named Sabine Surget, a former Ms. France. She was my girlfriend 
          at the time &#8211; but the movie had nothing to do with Ms. France 
          or anything like that. It was a realistic character sketch, kind of. 
          On 16 milimeter. I didn&#8217;t follow the script for the most part. 
          It was never released. In fact, we lost it. It was at this point when 
          I first became an artist, although I didn&#8217;t tell anyone that I 
          was an artist until &#8217;79 &#8211; in America. When I came back to 
          America, in 1970, you could meet Andy Warhol at a bar and if he likes 
          you he talks to you. That&#8217;s why I love America. In Paris at that 
          time it was so clubby that you couldn&#8217;t get mixed up with art 
          people unless you wanted doors slammed in you face all the time. This 
          was especially true for me because I am self-taught. Even so, independent 
          art film is what I was making from about &#8217;64 on. I fell into it. 
          It was the only way I could do what I wanted with sound and image.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> It sounds like you have always basically worked alone, 
          for your own reasons.<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Right. Well, I have collaborated with Gary Indiana 
          and so on. The only group I have ever participated in, even a little 
          bit, was Zanzibar. This was in the sixties, in Paris. These guys were 
          more like dandies, like me. Guys like Phillip Garrel, and so on. They 
          were very accepting of my work.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> So between &#8217;64 and &#8217;70 you made how many 
          films?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Probably six or seven, one hour long films. Everybody 
          was really reacting in this period to Godard, of course. He told his 
          own stories, and he was so free from the Hollywood system, the Hollywood 
          mentality. I shot my films myself, and I also edited them myself using 
          a hand-wound Moviola machine. These movies never had any synched sound. 
          Sometimes I would just use whatever was on the portable radio as my 
          soundtrack. I haven&#8217;t changed that much really since then. I have 
          always been a voyeur, but a voyeur with a very poetic sensibility. I 
          have always edited heavily, but not in an obvious way, you know. One 
          of early these films had beautiful Ectachrome footage of the protests 
          in &#8217;68, shot of course from the point of view of the protesters. 
          They&#8217;re all lost, all of these films.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> How did that happen?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> I put them in a Swiss film festival in &#8217;69. 
          I was with Viva by then, and we moved to Rome and then to America, and 
          I never talked to the guy who organized the festival. Maybe he&#8217;s 
          dead now, who knows? In &#8217;69 I didn&#8217;t care because I had 
          gotten some money from Sylvina Boissonas. She was a member of the Schlumberger 
          family and when she turned 21 she inherited some money from her grandmother 
          so she funded Zanzibar. She never told the group what to do with the 
          money. She didn&#8217;t want any control. So Zanzibar decided to throw 
          me some crumbs. Enough crumbs to finally make a film with synched sound. 
          This turned out to be Keeping Busy, starring Viva.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> You met Viva in Paris?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Yes. In &#8217;68 there was a showing of Chelsea 
          Girls at Iolas gallery. I went in by accident and totally flipped &#8211; 
          I thought it was the best fucking film I had ever seen in my life. It 
          seemed to validate my own self-taught approach. Anyway, I remembered 
          Nico from that movie, and one night I saw her on the street with another 
          girl. I didn&#8217;t know her but I said &#8221;Hey Nico! You want to 
          go to a party?!&#8221; She said &#8221;Yea, sure!&#8221; The girl she 
          was with turned out to be Viva.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> And you fell in love right away?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> We ended up getting together pretty much right away. 
          We left Paris for Rome in &#8217;69 to make Keeping Busy, then to the 
          States in 1970, where we were married. We had a lot of money in New 
          York, after the book Superstar was published, so we lived like the fucking 
          Rolling Stones until the money ran out. I bought one of the first portable 
          video cameras with some of the money. I was in heaven with that thing 
          even though it weighed a fucking ton. I finally had image and synched 
          sound together, on the spot. Instant gratification!<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> So you moved from France to America, and from film 
          to video, and you never looked back ?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Maybe I&#8217;m making this period sound like it 
          was all so easy, but it wasn&#8217;t &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t painless. 
          Like when the money ran out, we would be in the fucking street you know, 
          and we would have to put something else together right away.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Where did you and Viva get married?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> In Las Vegas.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Did you propose to her?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> No. We were living in LA at the time. We came out 
          from New York City because Viva was starring in a film called Lion&#8217;s 
          Love by Agnes Varda. Also, you know who wrote that film? Those two crazy 
          motherfuckers &#8211; the two guys who did Hair. Everybody on the set 
          was getting drugs sent to them in wooden boxes from Dr. Feelgood. He 
          was here, in New York.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> You mean Dr. Robert? The guy in the Beatles song?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Right. He made a special mix of speed, heroin and 
          Vitamin B-12. Motherfuckers were shooting this shit into their arms. 
          One night we were all at a very like, hot party thrown by Roger Vadim. 
          Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate were there, like, probably a week before 
          she was killed. Jane Fonda was with Vadim at this time, and she was 
          in the kitchen using a dildo on herself like a choo-choo train&#8230;<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Like a choo-choo train? Why did she leave this off 
          of the exercise tapes?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> (Laughs) She said like, &#8221;Here comes the choo-choo,&#8221; 
          you know. So I was downstairs in the kitchen with Barbarella, and Viva 
          was upstairs with Roger. Driving home Viva got very upset and depressed 
          about all this fooling around and insisted that we drive to Vegas and 
          get married. I didn&#8217;t give a shit about the fooling around because 
          I&#8217;m a fucking voyeur, but I loved Viva, so that&#8217;s what we 
          did. We interrupted the Lion&#8217;s Love shoot to do it.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> And you and Viva have kids right?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> I have one daughter with Viva, who was born in February 
          of 1971, and Viva has another daughter also that is like a daughter 
          to me. They&acute;re both fantastic.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> I was born in &#8217;71 as well. The son of a runaway 
          choo-choo&#8230;<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Ah, so you&#8217;re young enough to be my son. Well 
          listen to me my son, you&#8217;d better get it right &#8211; every goddamn 
          thing that I&#8217;m saying! (Laughs).<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> You mentioned drugs on the set of Lion&#8217;s Love. 
          When did you start doing drugs? How did they effect your work?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> I didn&#8217;t really even smoke pot until &#8217;67 
          or &#8217;68. I really didn&#8217;t like it because I had been plaugued 
          by paranoia all my life and pot only made it worse. In &#8217;68 I was 
          at a party thrown by this huge international drug dealer on a small 
          Spanish island called Formentera. They were giving out LSD and opium 
          at the gate. I pretended that I had done LSD for some reason, so they 
          gave me a lot. So I start getting high and my paranoia grew to a ridiculous 
          level. I heard laughter from the party and thought everybody was laughing 
          at me. I ran out into the fields and spent the night hiding the haystacks. 
          The hay was decomposing and it gave off like, 100-degree heat. It was 
          like a natural sauna so I began to relax. At sunrise I stumbled back 
          to the party, heard people laughing and realized that they were just 
          having fun of course. My childhood paranoia was almost gone after that. 
          I got other kinds of paranoia later.<br>
          I was a heroin addict from &#8217;78 to &#8217;86. This was my Prozac 
          really. It was mood control that I took so I didn&#8217;t kill myself. 
          I never used a needle. But none of these drugs ever affected my work 
          formally really. I think I have been fairly consistent in my interests 
          no matter what drugs I may or may not be taking.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Why would you have killed yourself otherwise?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> I was often very depressed, isolated, and I felt 
          like an outcast all my life. I took heroin thinking I could moderate 
          my intake, but that&acute;s not the way it works &#8211; nothing comes 
          free, you know? But I had never had a problem with anything before. 
          This illusion of control is what the video My Last Bag of Heroin (For 
          Real) is all about. Junkies always say that each bag is the last one 
          they&#8217;re going to do. It just so happens though, that this was 
          my last bag. I made this tape in &#8217;86 and forgot about it until 
          &#8217;88 when I was cleaning up the studio.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Don&#8217;t you think the fascination surrounding 
          junkies is a bit corny? Isn&#8217;t it corny to romanticize self-inflicted 
          damage?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Like I said, for me it was self-medication, not 
          romance, although when I was young I was always intrigued by the idea 
          of the dandy, Baudelaire and so on. I would say that using heroin is 
          better than killing yourself, and it&#8217;s a great high of course, 
          but I never romanticized it. I was surprised when Cindy (Sherman) wanted 
          to get married. I mean, I would never marry a junkie. I know what you 
          mean though. I hate it when people clean up and then act like they&#8217;re 
          holy all of a sudden. You know, people like Lou Reed. They want to judge 
          everybody who is still on drugs, and at the same time act like, &#8221;Hey 
          look, I&#8217;ve been through more than you,&#8221; to the people who 
          have never done them.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> When did you meet Cindy Sherman?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> I met her in New York, at the Kitchen in the early 
          &#8217;80s. The Kitchen was really a regular gallery thing for me for 
          a while, thanks to Tom Bowes who was the video curator there. Cindy 
          and I were married at city hall in &#8217;83. She was fantastic of course 
          &#8211; she&#8217;s very shy, very easy to like. Cindy was an inspiration 
          to me as well because she was totally dedicated to working, and she 
          helped me to stabilize my life, and eventually to clean up. After I 
          cleaned up I kind of disappered for a couple of years behind the wall 
          of her money and fame and tried to figure out what to make next. During 
          our marriage I met all the biggest curators in the world of course, 
          but I never tried to talk to them about my work. They were there to 
          meet Cindy. Of course I was delighted for her, but after many years 
          it got to be difficult.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> And you&#8217;re hardly what I would call a careerist, 
          or a schmoozer.<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Right.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Who else besides Cindy helped you or inspired you?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Taylor Mead, Gary Indiana, Bob Smith&#8230;<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> All gay men.<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Right. I was roommates with Bob Smith for a while. 
          Gary wrote A Coupla White Faggots Sitting Around Talking as a vehicle 
          for Taylor to be able to make fun of Truman Capote. Taylor is brilliant 
          in that thing. We all had fun being outcasts together I guess.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Did you ever meet Jack Smith?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> I did meet him at some point through Jackie Curtis, 
          but he was pretty far into his own world by that time.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Who else were you close to?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Alice Neel was a totally incredible friend to me. 
          She did a portrait of me and I did a video of her talking also. I was 
          really inspired, not so much by the paintings directly, but by her energy 
          and her outlook. I think we are similar also in that the work seems 
          like, too present or too close to real life at first, but then as it 
          ages great things begin to come through.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> I agree.<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Thank you son! (Laughs)<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Yeah, I mean it&#8217;s striking to me that even 
          though you were one of the first artists working seriously with a portable 
          video unit, I think it probably wasn&#8217;t until the early &#8217;90s 
          that the art world could really be considered a friendly place for your 
          sort of proto-slacker, sometimes staged, sometimes diaristic approach.<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> I had some great critical responses here and there, 
          from Jonas Mekas in the &#8217;70s, from Bob Riley in the &#8217;80s, 
          but you&#8217;re probably right in general.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Now there&#8217;s everything from Sam Taylor Wood 
          to Dogma &#8217;95.<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> It&#8217;s funny because I never see films in the 
          theater, but some students in Denmark talked me into riding bicycles 
          with them, something like twenty fucking miles, to see Dancer In The 
          Dark. I didn&#8217;t want to but I loved it. I mean it was totally annoying 
          to watch Bjork crying all the time, and it was totally annoying to find 
          myself crying also, but it was really, really well done. I think writing 
          up a list of the rules is a little much though &#8211; I don&#8217;t 
          know. People use manifestos to make money. I have used a lot of the 
          Dogma rules at various times, and many years before Dogma, but I thought 
          it was obvious what I was doing. I was just doing what I was naturally 
          drawn to do.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Was there anything else that you liked in the theater 
          recently? <br>
          <strong>MA</strong> I liked Eyes Wide Shut in some ways.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Really? Wasn&#8217;t that whole orgy thing a bit 
          thespian?<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> Not really. I think that&#8217;s realistic. I mean 
          it&#8217;s realistic to people like Kubrick. As a young man in Paris 
          I went to orgies at a place called Le Marroniers. You would go through 
          the kitchen and there was a family making food for everybody, and then 
          you go behind and there are all these rooms with rich people fucking 
          each other. There were always rumors about who had been there the last 
          time. &#8221;You just missed Alain Delon!&#8221; That kind of thing. 
          You had to get your name at the door somehow. My friend got us in because 
          we were both young and ready to do whatever, you know. I think that&#8217;s 
          what Kubrick is showing &#8211; he&#8217;s showing what he knows.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> Right, right. I know what you&#8217;re talking about. 
          I get invited to stuff like that all the time.<br>
          <strong>MA</strong> (Laughs) </p>
