        <p class="orange">The Games: Olympic Variations<br>
          1984, 25 minutes</p>
        <p>Unable to attend the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Auder decided 
          to make a work using footage taken directly from television. In an ode 
          to human flexibility &aacute; la the pelvis, Auder manages to reinstates 
          something of the Olympics' ancient Greek origins. The emphasis is on 
          the expressive capacity of the human physique under athletic strain 
          rather than the drama of international competition. </p>
        <p>The work's dominant stylistic feature is the use of scratch video in 
          which brief clips of video are rapidly repeated creating an uncanny 
          sense of deferral. Between Auder's unabashed crotch gazing and his deft 
          use of scratch video, the human body is simultaneously eroticized and 
          mechanized. The production of human perfection, reiterated through repetition, 
          is accompanied by suggestions of its biological reproduction. </p>
        <p>Auder's Olympics are a spectacle of their own in which we consciously 
          idealize ourselves and our aquatic origins as a species. The appropriation 
          of television imagery used to critique the media allows Auder to be 
          counted amongst his contemporaries of the period which include Barbara 
          Krueger, Richard Prince, and Sherrie Levine.</p>
