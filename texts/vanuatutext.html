             <p class="orange">The Vanuatu Chronicles<br>
          1998, 277 minutes</p>
        <p class="blacktext">Vanuatu, formerly New Hebrides, is an island country 
          in the southern Pacific Ocean, east of northern Australia. This non-narrative 
          travel-log is a saga simply by virtue of its length. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">It is screened continuously so viewers can enter 
          at any point. More than likely they will encounter passages which are 
          ethnographic in nature, documenting in rich detail, the landscape, rituals 
          and lives of Vanutians who inhabit one of the smaller islands. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">This type of footage occupies the greater portion 
          of the piece. Particularly striking is the capture of an enormous eel 
          at a waterfall on the island's interior or stretches of beach, blackened 
          by volcanic sands in which Vanutians draw elaborate curvilinear patterns 
          that have been passed down to them for generations. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">Although it beautifully depicts Vanuatu, the piece 
          is about Auder whose impetus to travel to the other side of the globe 
          came under personal duress of a failed marriage. (His second marriage 
          to the artist Cindy Sherman was dissolving.) In this respect, it shares 
          an affinity with Morocco 1972. But unlike the Moroccan Chronicles there 
          was no wife to edit from the footage. Just Auder trying to substitute 
          geographic for emotional excape. It is a study in self consciousness 
          as Auder repeatedly turns the lens on himself, in many instances having 
          nothing to say. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">The work starts with him packing his bags and arriving 
          at the country's capital, Vila where he stays at a bland hotel whose 
          sterility he documents as a foil to the rest of the trip. He befriends 
          one of the hotel workers who takes him to his native remote island where 
          Auder spends the majority of his stay. He returns to the hotel only 
          once before leaving. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">Although the piece is non-narrative it has a structure 
          which involves cycles of dissipation in Auder's selfconsciousness. Unlike 
          other works in which he appears, in Vanuatu, Auder is extremely conscious 
          of his own presence. The country serves as a backdrop into which Auder 
          at times fails and others succeeds in pasting himself only to lose himself 
          in the fantasy of a simpler life. </p>
