        <p class="orange">Chronicles: Family Diaries<br>
          1971-1973 (Excerpts), 68 minutes </p>
        <p class="blacktext">The Chronicles define Auder's practice as a body 
          of work. The Chronicles are autobiographical chapters documenting the 
          events, people and places which have constituted his life. They consist 
          of sequences culled from hours of raw footage. Stylistically, Auder 
          is not so much interested in capturing events as much as he is allowing 
          them to unfold so that the character of a given situation or subject 
          can express itself unconsciously through the many details of its context.</p>
        <p class="blacktext"> The Family Diaries are amongst his earliest footage. 
          For many of his first endeavors as a &#148;video artist&#148;, Auder 
          would find a means to recycle small portions of this footage, inserting 
          segments into discreetly composed art works such as Made For Denise 
          and Chasing The Dragon. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">Over time, however, Chronicles: Family Diaries have 
          become works in themselves. Much of the earliest footage represents 
          a collaboration with Viva, his wife of the time and former Warhol star. 
        </p>
        <p class="blacktext">One of their projects was to vividly document the 
          birth and early years of their daughter Alexandra. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">Although portions of the Chronicles: Family Diaries 
          1971-1973 (Exerpts) documents the hectic nature of the couples life 
          (Viva had not only recently given birth but also published a memoir 
          entitled Superstar) the greater part of these excerpts is given over 
          to intimate scenes of mother and child. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">The final excerpts star Alexandra at age two in what 
          could only be dubbed a real life version of Lord of the Flies.</p>
