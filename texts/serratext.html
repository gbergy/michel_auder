              <p class="orange">T.W.U. Richard Serra, An Unsolicited Video by Michel Auder<br>
          1980-82, re-edit 2002, 14 minutes</p>
        <p class="blacktext">Before Titled Arc, there was T.W.U. On a beautiful 
          morning in 1980, Auder awoke to the sudden sound of construction. Eager 
          to find out what was going on, he rushed out of his apartment with camera 
          in hand. He arrived in time to catch the installation of T.W.U., a monumental 
          work by Serra being installed at Franklin Street and West Broadway. 
        </p>
        <p class="blacktext">The footage captures Serra and dealer Leo Castelli 
          amongst a crowd of by-standers observing the crew as they hoist and 
          mount the final slab of steel. Two years later, Auder is awoken by similar 
          sounds. Again, camera in hand he witnesses the de-installation of T.W.U. 
          with its bolts being removed from the final slab which is then lowered 
          onto a flatbed. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">Although the circumstances leading to the work's 
          dismantling are unclear, a prominent layer of flyers plastered to the 
          work's exterior is telling of the work's ultimate fate as a degraded 
          and forgotten monument alienated from the positivist spirit surrounding 
          its installation.</p>
