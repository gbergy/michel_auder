		  Portrait of Alice Neel<br>
          1976-1982, 120 minutes</p>
        <p class="blacktext">Auder considers Neel to have been one of his closest 
          friends. This is confirmed by his endearing footage. Although Neel was 
          much beloved by numerous well known cultural figures many of whom she 
          painted, she did not receive major recognition until her later years. 
        </p>
        <p class="blacktext">These segments begin in 1976, two years after her 
          first retrospective held at the Whitney in 1974. Neel is captured in 
          several settings &#150; at work with a range of sitters, on vacation 
          in Bermuda, and at a major birthday celebration in her honor at Gracie 
          Mansion. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">The piece opens with Neel rummaging through her studio 
          as well as her memories, pulling out paintings and a host of related 
          anecdotes. The overwhelming sense of intimacy is indeed like being granted 
          the privilege of a studio visit. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">Her pronouncements about life and death can only 
          be weighed against this footage of her surrounded by her paintings and 
          at work immortalizing those she loved. Neel passed away 1985 at the 
          age of 85.</p>
