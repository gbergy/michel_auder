        <p class="orange">Chasing The Dragon<br>
          1982, 43 minutes</p>
        <p class="blacktext">Produced for the Kitchen, one of the first venues 
          to champion video art, Chasing The Dragon was in many ways confirmation 
          of Auder's full fledged status as an artist. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">It's title refers to a method of smoking heroin. 
          It's subject, a self-absorbed video artist with a heroin habit, is largely 
          autobiographical. Although based upon Auder's circumstances of that 
          time, Chasing The Dragon is a collaboration with its star, Eric Bogosian 
          and writer/painter Michael Zwack. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">Viewing this work, twenty years later, its Lower 
          East Side mis en scene &#150; with its vacant buildings, rubble strewn 
          lots and automobile caresses &#150; more closely resembles the slums 
          of Jacob Riis than its current manifestation. The work recycles footage 
          Auder shot throughout the 1970s much of which features his daughter 
          Alexandra Auder. Bogosian's presence makes this a work of the 1980s. 
        </p>
        <p class="blacktext">Yet, a cameo by Jim Jim, heroin dealer of Velvet 
          Underground fame, connects the work, and by default, Auder, to the subculture 
          of a previous generation which inhabited much of the same stomping grounds.</p>
