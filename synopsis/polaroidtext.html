    <p class="orange">Polaroid Cocaine<br>
      1993, 5 minutes</p>
    <p>The thrill of cocaine becomes a metaphor for the consumption of images 
      in this short montage. The title and lyrics come from Auder&acute;s 
      friend and 2001 Prix Goncourt winner Jean-Jacques Shuhl. The piece is 
      composed entirely of still photographs from a variety of books and magazines 
      that simultaneously reveal and feed an addiction to spectacle. </p>
    <p>With a source that is once removed, Auder's scopophilia is symptomatic 
      of society at large. The song is performed by legendary chanteuse Ingrid 
      Caven. Suffused with a bittersweet melancholy, Canven's seasoned voice 
      compliments Auder's selection of images which dwell on the themes of 
      death, destruction and desire. </p>
    <p>The melody is classic cabaret performed by a piano/violin duo who dramatically 
      heighten the works already dark eroticism. </p>
