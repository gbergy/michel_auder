    <p class="orange">Brooding Angels, Made for R.L.<br>
      1988, 6 minutes</p>
    <p>From its fiery outset, Brooding Angles is decidedly gothic and the 
      mood anxious. It is a dark rumination on the specter of authority, resistance 
      and paranoia marking the close of Reagan's second term in office. </p>
    <p>Born in 1945, Auder came of age during the 1960s, a decade as tumultuous 
      in France as it was in the United States. The decade culminated in the 
      student/worker strikes of May 1968 that shut down the city of Paris. 
      Auder's value system was in many respects shaped by this anti-authoritarian 
      milieu. </p>
    <p>Its remnants are to be found in his preponderance with issues violence 
      and conflict as they serve to question moral progress. The soundtrack's 
      ominous melody is recycled from footage of cellist David Soyer that 
      can be seen in A Portrait of Alice Neel.</p>
