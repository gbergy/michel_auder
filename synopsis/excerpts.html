          <p class="blacktext"> When I was about 17 I started to make photographs. 
          The only thing my father left in the house was an old Rolei-Flex, and 
          when I looked into it I could see 6x6 in the depolir, the beautiful 
          unpolished glass, the grid and the colour image of outside. It was fascinating 
          to me, to open the camera&#8217;s leather case and see these beautiful 
          images. It was a mystery for me, who could never understand anything 
          about anything, it was like a miracle. I didn&#8217;t have to use film, 
          I could just look in the camera and see movies. Then my father left 
          and I started to make pictures, that was my first step, and later I 
          got interested in film. I didn&#8217;t think making photographs was 
          that interesting and I would go to the movies all the time. This guy, 
          the first assistant to the photographer I worked for as a runner, found 
          someone to give me an Arriflex camera and some film to shoot a small 
          movie. It&#8217;s lost now, but everyone was kind of amazed that I made 
          a movie. It was like Alain Resnais&#8217; Last Year at Marienbad, my 
          own version of it. That must have been before I went to the army, I 
          was 18 years old. I made a lot of films with a 16mm camera which are 
          all lost, but they were like diary films, in colour, very beautifully 
          shot. By 1967 I saw some movies by Jean-Luc Godard and Andy Warhol and 
          they opened my mind to the fact that you could make films differently 
          from the principles that had been laid out for so many years in the 
          Hollywood system. I thought it was too low for me to be a fashion photographer, 
          I wanted to be a film director. I was always looking for something that 
          would give me the sound and image right away. Aesthetically I wasn&acute;t 
          too obsessed with whatever the product was, whatever it gave I could 
          adapt to. Video was a dream I was waiting for and as soon as it happened 
          I got one.<br>
          <br>
          One night I was walking in the street and I saw two women coming towards 
          me. It was Nico and Viva, they were in Paris. Three weeks before I had 
          just seen Chelsea Girls at Alexander Iolas Gallery and I thought it 
          was the greatest thing I ever saw in my life. I said, &#8221;Nico, I&#8217;m 
          making a film, I want both of you to be in it&#8221;. They said, &#8221;Ah, 
          why don&#8217;t you come with us, we&#8217;re going to a party.&#8221; 
          So I went with them to a party thrown by some rich character from New 
          York who was helping everybody, giving everyone drugs and playing the 
          patron. I had the money to make a film so I went to Rome with Viva and 
          Louis Waldon because Philippe Garrel was shooting there and his producer 
          had given me the money to do something. Philippe had said I could use 
          his camera. We moved into a hotel and I shot Keeping Busy. Viva got 
          a call from Agnes Varda, she wanted to shoot a film called Lion&#8217;s 
          Love with her in Hollywood. They called Rome and Viva said &#8221;Well, 
          I&#8217;ve got my boyfriend here, if you don&#8217;t give a ticket for 
          him I&#8217;m not coming.&#8221;<br>
          <br>
          So they sent a ticket for both of us and put us up in Hollywood while 
          Viva was shooting and we became very close.<br>
          <br>
          We drove to Las Vegas and we got drunk and went to a little drive-in 
          chapel and got married. When the movie was over, we went to New York 
          and had no place to stay so we moved into the Chelsea Hotel. It was 
          in 1970. There were all those Warhol Factory people around all the time, 
          like Ondine, Taylor Mead, Andrea Feldman&#8230; . All these people are 
          in my film Cleopatra, which I only have the remnants of. You almost 
          can&#8217;t see the film, it&#8217;s a very bad copy that was put on 
          videotape. The sound is also very bad. I raised money to make the movie 
          when the New York Times made a big feature on Viva. I said &#8221;I 
          want some money to make a film with Viva called Cleopatra, using all 
          the Warhol crowd to act like they were Caesar and Cleopatra.&#8221; 
          I had five producers call me, that&#8217;s how powerful the newspapers 
          are! Most of them pulled out, but one guy did put up the money, which 
          was like $200 000 then, probably worth like a $1 000 000 now. My only 
          demand was that I didn&#8217;t want to be bothered by anybody while 
          I was shooting, they couldn&#8217;t come and interfere. When the movie 
          was over they got very upset when they saw what I had done and they 
          physically destroyed the film. Henri Langlois at the Cin&eacute;math&eacute;que 
          Francaise wanted to show it in Cannes and the only thing I had left 
          was a work copy that I had in the editing room where I was working, 
          and they&#8217;d changed the locks. So I broke in the door and the film 
          was half-edited and about four hours long but I carried it out before 
          security arrived. We went to Cannes to show it and they wired to say 
          &#8221;If you show the film, we&#8217;ll sue you.&#8221; But it was 
          too late, we already had shown it in a special screening. They sued 
          me for a couple of million dollars. So we had to give that copy back, 
          too, but Jonas Mekas from Anthology Film Archives, he made another copy 
          of it and that&#8217;s all I have left. It&#8217;s third generation 
          of a film that wasn&#8217;t even printed right, just a work print, but 
          it&#8217;s got some style because of that, too.<br>
          <br>
          The filmmaker Shirley Clarke was living in the penthouse on the roof 
          of the Chelsea Hotel around 1969. She got a video camera and we played 
          with it together. For me it was the answer for making films as a personal 
          filmmaker. When I made Cleopatra I knew it was my last movie. I knew 
          that by the way I conducted myself with the producers, disregarding 
          them because they just wanted to make money off me. I despised the idea 
          that the film business would be like this forever, so I stopped dealing 
          with the Hollywood type of film to make something that really came from 
          me alone, whenever I wanted. Video was the answer, but not immediately 
          because there was nothing you could do with the videotapes back then. 
          It seemed like I was in a no man&#8217;s land for many years because 
          the first bunch of videotapes like Chelsea Girls With Andy Warhol, The 
          Cockettes, The Chronicles were all made to be put on film, that was 
          my idea, to transfer them to film to be shown. The problem was that 
          it was too expensive, a lot of money I could never find. Being so busy 
          surviving and paying rent and everything, I kept making the product 
          but never coming out with anything final, but I obsessively kept making 
          tapes and I haven&acute;t stopped 30 years later.<br>
          <br>
          During the 70s I was using my life as the basic material to make the 
          work. I never saw that it was really my personal life, I only saw it 
          in a schizophrenic way like it wasn&#8217;t really me. It&#8217;s like 
          I was putting myself into the situations to make video. I didn&#8217;t 
          think that my life was so interesting, it was the people around that 
          were interesting. Back then it was like my whole life was staged to 
          make videotapes. I didn&#8217;t have a real life, it was all about making 
          works. I never did anything with my tapes until 1980.<br>
          <br>
          For six, seven, eight years there was no way out, or I couldn&#8217;t 
          find any way out. What really made me get into it again was when The 
          Kitchen began &#8211; which was one of the first alternative exhibition 
          spaces focusing on performance, video, dance, and anything too out for 
          the rest of the art world &#8211; and they were interested in videotape 
          so I produced a few projects to show there. I had to wait until that 
          time to figure something out with the work. I started to think of making 
          pieces like Jesus where I interviewed all kinds of crazy people, just 
          for soundbites. That&#8217;s all it is, but when I make a soundbite 
          it can go on for five minutes at a time and the tape is long. It&#8217;s 
          pretty funny. I wouldn&#8217;t say I invented it, but it&#8217;s a style 
          that has been used a lot since. There was a time when even TV didn&#8217;t 
          think that way, now that style is totally incorporated into the mainstream 
          &#8230; asking questions to all kinds of people and then editing it 
          together. For another show at The Kitchen, I made a collage of little 
          vignettes called Stories, Myths, Ironies &amp; Songs.<br>
          <br>
          It&#8217;s a poetic assemblage of different sections from my old videotapes 
          and some new stuff I made at that time.<br>
          <br>
          The soundtracks are all elaborately collaged &#8211; the sound is always 
          very important to me. Once the opportunities opened up I came to a period 
          where I used actors again because there was a new generation of Lower 
          East Side people.<br>
          <br>
          I made Seduction of Patrick and A Coupla White Faggots with Gary Indiana, 
          Taylor Mead, Jackie Curtis, Cookie Mueller&#8230; . Then in The Video 
          Diary of a Madman I used Eric Bogosian. I always worked by myself, I 
          carried the lights, I set up everything, always a one-man band. I made 
          a lot of tapes with no money and a heavy herion habit.<br>
          When I met Cindy Sherman in 1982, she had a buzz around her but she 
          lived in a flat without a bathroom, you had to step out into the hall. 
          We got along so well that we got married five months after we met. Cindy 
          accepted that I had a sickness, she accepted my heroin habit, she&#8217;s 
          so not nuts but for her it didn&#8217;t seem strange.<br>
          <br>
          I would never live with a junkie in my life, if you paid me I wouldn&#8217;t 
          do it. I know too well the complexity of it. It must have been a nightmare 
          but Cindy accepted it. By that time I wanted to quit but I didn&#8217;t 
          know what to do.<br>
          <br>
          Then Cindy started to sell more pictures, was making more money and 
          she finally got health insurance and since we were married I was able 
          to go to a real detox that was covered by insurance and somehow I made 
          the decision to stop. In the late 80s when I&#8217;d recovered from 
          being an addict it seemed like everybody around me was making tons of 
          money, it was the big art boom. People would look at me like &#8221;What 
          are you doing making videotapes? Why don&#8217;t you do something else, 
          videotapes will take you nowhere, ever.&#8221; People would say I came 
          from the 70s as an insult. Then suddenly all those guys started selling 
          paintings and stuff for a lot of money &#8211; everybody I knew cashed 
          in. I thought again that maybe video was the wrong thing to do, I couldn&#8217;t 
          argue with those people because I felt like I was a looser. But I never 
          really considered stopping making videotapes, it&#8217;s what I do. 
          It&#8217;s my pleasure and my pain, it&#8217;s my life. I don&#8217;t 
          know how else to function. I stayed silent and just felt lucky that 
          I could still experiment with my work and not worry too much.<br>
          <br>
          The first person who gave me a chance again was Nicole Klagsbrun. I 
          knew her and she came to visit my studio and suggested we do a show 
          together, this was 1993. It was the first time I had a gallery, or a 
          place &#8211; I don&#8217;t care to be an artist or anything, that&#8217;s 
          not the point, but I need an outlet. Television doesn&#8217;t want my 
          work and I&#8217;m not into the movie business, so the only other outlet 
          is the art world. Saying to myself &#8221;I&#8217;m a video artist&#8221; 
          is a weird thing, you know. There&#8217;s no definition, I just go along 
          with it because I don&#8217;t know how to put the tapes out any other 
          place.<br>
          <br>
          At Nicole&#8217;s I made a tape called Voyage to the Center of the Phone 
          Lines for one room as a kind of installation, then downstairs I played 
          another tape called Made For Nicole K. which is eight different short 
          pieces.<br>
          <br>
          I had a list of tapes that people could ask to see if no one was watching 
          anything downstairs and of course almost no one asked for the tapes. 
          At the entrance I had 20 videotapes on a shelf, I went to lengths to 
          make copies and re-edit them and put my work in order. I showed with 
          her a number of times and then she closed the gallery and AC Project 
          Room picked me up. Having more shows made me do more research and more 
          works.<br>
          <br>
          I wish I could make only two-minute tapes, I wish I could make installations 
          because I have some ideas, but whatever, it&#8217;s just the way it 
          comes out of me. My work is a gut feeling, I can&#8217;t do it any different. 
          That&#8217;s why I kept all my work, not because I think it&#8217;s 
          great but because I had some kind of calling to shoot every minute of 
          it.<br>
          There&#8217;s no reason for me to erase it even if it looks bad. Experience 
          has told me I can look back 20 years later and find something interesting. 
          I was smart enough to understand that things get older and the meanings 
          change. Without even thinking about it I know everything has to be kept 
          because I know it&#8217;s going to be useful, if not the image then 
          the soundtrack. I don&#8217;t think about it, I shoot something and 
          that&#8217;s it, it&#8217;s in the boxes, it&#8217;s not going to move, 
          it&#8217;s part of my work.<br>
