    <p class="orange"> Cleopatra<br>
      1970, 155 minutes<br>
      (film transferred to DVD)</p>
    <p class="blacktext">Cleopatra situates itself in the same relationship 
      to Hollywood as the Warhol/Morrisey films of the period. It corresponds 
      to Joseph Mankiewicz's 1963 Cleopatra, starring Elizabeth Taylor and 
      Richard Burton which Auder's cast watched and used as the starting point 
      for scene by scene improvisation Auder drew his cast from Warhol's ensemble 
      &#150; including not only Viva and Louis Waldon, but also Taylor Mead, 
      Ondine, Andrea Feldman, Gerard Melanga and others. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">The film revels in epic excess like Mankiewicz's 
      cinematic debacle which succumbed to vast length, a bloted budget, multiple 
      revisions and a scandal occasioned by the extramarital escapades of 
      its co-stars. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">In Auder's Cleopatra, Viva is the queen, shrieking 
      with an authority different from the languorous speech patterns she 
      had perfected in Warhol's films. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">The (newly invented) snowmobile substitutes for horses; 
      the industrial setting of a factory becomes a showplace of armaments, 
      and the whole Egypt section takes place in upstate New York. The streets 
      and parks of Rome, where Waldon lived at the time, are the staging ground 
      for his role as Caesar. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">In a wonderful display of Waldon's charm and skills 
      as an improviser, he begins a dialogue with local police who are then 
      conscripted into the film as Roman soldiers. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">Auder shot the culminating orgy and gladiator scenes 
      in the famous Cin&eacute;cita film studio in Rome where Mankiewicz filmed. 
      Due to a fight with his producers, Auder never edited the film which 
      was lost for many years. It survives as an uncut degraded copy of the 
      original.</p>
