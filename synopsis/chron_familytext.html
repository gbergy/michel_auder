    <p class="orange">Chronicles: Family Diaries<br>
      1971-1973 (Excerpts), 68 minutes </p>
    <p class="blacktext">The Chronicles define Auder's practice as a body 
      of work. The Chronicles are autobiographical chapters documenting the 
      events, people and places which have constituted his life. They consist 
      of sequences culled from hours of raw footage. Stylistically, Auder 
      is not so much interested in capturing events as much as he is allowing 
      them to unfold so that the character of a given situation or subject 
      can express itself unconsciously through the many details of its context.</p>
    <p class="blacktext"> The Family Diaries are amongst his earliest footage. 
      For many of his first endeavors as a &#148;video artist&#148;, Auder 
      would find a means to recycle small portions of this footage, inserting 
      segments into discreetly composed art works such as Made For Denise 
      and Chasing The Dragon. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">Over time, however, Chronicles: Family Diaries have 
      become works in themselves. Much of the earliest footage represents 
      a collaboration with Viva, his wife of the time and former Warhol star. 
    </p>
    <p class="blacktext">One of their projects was to vividly document the 
      birth and early years of their daughter Alexandra. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">Although portions of the Chronicles: Family Diaries 
      1971-1973 (Exerpts) documents the hectic nature of the couples life 
      (Viva had not only recently given birth but also published a memoir 
      entitled Superstar) the greater part of these excerpts is given over 
      to intimate scenes of mother and child. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">The final excerpts star Alexandra at age two in what 
      could only be dubbed a real life version of Lord of the Flies.</p>
