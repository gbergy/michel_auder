    <p class="orange">Morocco 1972: The Real Chronicles with Viva<br>
      2002, 33 minutes</p>
    <p>Auder alternately refers to the Chronicles as video diaries or novels 
      that are Proustian in nature. </p>
    <p>These two Chronicles are actually closer to the work of Paul Bowles. 
      They capture the natural and cultural beauty of Morocco from its ancient 
      walled villages to its nomadic caravans. Music comes from everywhere. 
    </p>
    <p>Edited almost thirty years apart, the two Chronicles together are a 
      study in Auder's approach to his memories. The footage is all from the 
      same trip that was a family vacation. </p>
    <p>Tension developed between the couple and Viva left a few weeks into 
      the trip while Auder remained for several more months. Auder subsequently 
      edited Viva out of the first version. He also misdated the trip by accident. 
      It took place in 1972 not 1971. </p>
    <p>Considering Chronicles/Morocco, 1971 a construct of emotional convenience 
      unfaithful to memory, Auder decided to supplement the first version 
      with a fuller account. </p>
    <p>The two works feature almost entirely different footage. There are, 
      however, sections where one can see where Auder has omitted Viva. The 
      star of the 1971 version is a young Moroccan Adonis who appoints himself 
      tour-guide for a group of Europeans including Michel. </p>
    <p>The camera follows his charming antics as he flaunts his nubile body 
      and rather blunt but effective skills as a hunter. The supplement, Morocco 
      1972, stars Viva and Alexandra, continuing the theme of mother and child 
      as it was poignantly established in the Family Diaries.</p>
