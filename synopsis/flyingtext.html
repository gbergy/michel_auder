    <p class="orange">Flying<br>
      1983, 4 minutes</p>
    <p>Auder uses airplane flight to explore the relationship between the 
      imaginary, the symbolic and the real. The piece consists of imagery 
      appropriated from television and footage Auder recorded firsthand. The 
      boundary between his sources, however, is hopelessly blurred through 
      the use of re-recorded imagery that is rapidly interspersed throughout 
      the piece. </p>
    <p>It is not a question of fact versus fiction (the real versus the imaginary) 
      but the extent to which our experiences are mediated through degrees 
      of fantasy in a more general sense. Footage of a young boy is poignantly 
      contrasted with that of a young male pilot seated in the cockpit of 
      a small aircraft. Through the aid of a toy plane, the boy enacts maneuvers 
      the pilot will likely undergo in reality. </p>
    <p>This pairing is then disrupted by images of flight taken from television. 
      The result is a rapidly alternating discourse between childhood fantasy, 
      adulthood reality out of which emerges a more real uncertainty.
