    <p class="orange">Chronicles: Van's Last Performance<br>
      1971, edited 2002, 55 minutes</p>
    <p class="blacktext">Auder considers this chapter of the Chronicles a 
      collaboration between himself and Broadway producer Van Wolff who was 
      diagnosed with terminal cancer. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">With only a couple of weeks to live, Wolff asked 
      Auder if he would document his farewell to friends and family. The footage 
      was taken over a two day period, December 24th and 25th of 1971 during 
      Wolff's final radiation treatment and his subsequent release from the 
      hospital. It is both a portrait and a meditation on death which is captured 
      in the details. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">The journey to chemo is a particularly astounding 
      passage consisting of long takes through the hospital's endless corridors 
      broken only by jumpcuts that somehow seem to protract the experience. 
    </p>
    <p class="blacktext">Despite Wolff's casual demeanor in the face of death, 
      the piece captures his strength, dignity, arrogance and ongoing concern 
      with success. The work is bracketed by two cameos &#150; Charles Mingus 
      and Jack Nicholson &#150; who stop by to pay last respects and bid Van 
      adieu.<br>
