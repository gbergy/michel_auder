    <p class="orange">Voyage to the Center of the Phone Lines<br>
      1993, 55 minutes</p>
    <p class="blacktext">Voyage's structure is simple. Coastal landscape footage 
      and spectacular sunsets are combined with phone conversations recorded 
      from a scanner that picks up cordless phone frequencies. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">The result is a touching reflection on the tawdry 
      but tender world of human affairs. Although Voyage is non-narrative, 
      Auder chose to begin the work with a lengthy excerpt of conversation 
      between two devout Christians. This establishes the work's overarching 
      conceptual tone. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">The discrepancy between image and sound is analogous 
      to that between heaven and earth. Set within the context of paradise 
      lost, the chatter comes across as the displaced prayers of mortals. 
      (If God is listening, one can only hope she is forgiving of New York 
      accents.) </p>
    <p class="blacktext">The degrees of humor, despair and desperation vary, 
      lending Voyage a range of moods. Irony and omniscience, however, are 
      dispelled by the fact that to listen is to sympathize at which point 
      it becomes clear that this is no judgment seat, it's a mirror.</p>
