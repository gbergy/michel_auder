    <p class="orange">My Last Bag of Heroin (For Real)<br>
      1986, 4 minutes</p>
    <p>&#148;You know you're addicted to heroin when you begin proclaiming 
      every bag to be your last.&#148; Auder says this from experience. Throughout 
      the early and mid 1980s he was an addict. In this candid piece of disclosure 
      he demonstrates a method of smoking heroin referred to as Chasing the 
      Dragon. Drumming his fingers on the table-top while waiting for the 
      high to take effect, heroin use is depicted as a boredom far from bliss. 
      The work ends with Auder in a druginduced stupor, delivering a rambling 
      proclamation about kicking the habit, &#148;good-bye dope, good bye 
      monkey.&#148; </p>
    <p>The title's parenthetical (For Real), however, does not refer to the 
      fact that Auder actually made good on his proclamation. As Auder stated 
      &#148;I would have said those words regardless of whether or not I quit 
      because addicts delude themselves. In My Last Bag, I am only saying 
      what I had said so many times before.&#148; And by default, what he 
      potentially could have said so many times after having made the video. 
    </p>
    <p>The work's &#148;Real&#148; lesson is that confession no matter how 
      earnest should not be confused with truth.</p>
