    <p class="orange">Louis Waldon<br>
      1994, 82 minutes</p>
    <p class="blacktext">Louis Waldon starred in several Warhol films, Lonesome 
      Cowboys, Bike Boy, Nude Restaurant and most notably Blue Movie (1968) 
      featuring he and Viva. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">Blue Movie's scene of casual intercourse made it 
      a succ&eacute;s de scandal. The film was seized by New York Police after 
      a three month run; Warhol was faced with obscenity charges; and its 
      underground stars became underground superstars. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">The following year, 1969, Auder made Waldon's acquaintance 
      through Viva whom he had just met in Paris and would soon marry in Las 
      Vegas. But not before recruiting the two underground superstars to be 
      in his movie, Keeping Busy which is how Auder and Waldon became fast 
      friends. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">From the opening moments of Louis Waldon, it is clear 
      the two friends have fallen out of touch with no indication when they 
      last saw each other. After a quick survey of Waldon's small cluttered 
      apartment, Waldon quickly recounts the humorous circumstances under 
      which they met, revealing his disbelief (sustained over a period of 
      twenty-five years) that Auder actually married Viva whom he (Waldon) 
      knew to be somewhat nuts. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">At one point, as an aid to memory, he plays a video 
      tape of Warhol's Nude Restaurant and Tub Girls which features one of 
      Viva's notorious selfabsorbed monologues. But despite Waldon's charms, 
      which are brusque and many, it is a portrait in-full whose details are 
      rather sad.</p>
    <p class="blacktext"> They feature a scene of substance abuse; passing 
      mention of he and his son's estrangement; and a scene revealing how 
      he supplements his meager actor's income by making beautiful knock-offs 
      of Warhol silk-screen paintings. But the portrait is ultimately defined 
      by warmth of character drawn from the embers of friendship.  <br>
