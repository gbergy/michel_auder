    <p class="orange">Chronicles: Colombian Wedding<br>
      (April 1999) 2002, 48 minutes</p>
    <p class="blacktext">Auder was invited to a wedding in Pereira, Comombia. 
      He used the occasion to craft one of his most breathtaking travel logs. 
    </p>
    <p class="blacktext">A few months prior to Auder's trip, Pierata suffered 
      an intense earthquake. The second morning after his arrival he surveys 
      the damage to nearby buildings from his hotel window. From there he 
      proceeds to capture some of the street life. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">After a couple days in town he moves to the outskirts, 
      staying with the bride's family which is busy with wedding preparations. 
      The family is of considerable means, headed by a patriarch Auder observes 
      receiving a manicure. The estate, surrounded by spectacular vistas of 
      Comombia's verdant mountains, contains a variety of flora and fauna, 
      to which Auder is instinctively drawn. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">But what emerges between the landscape and the celebration 
      is actually a portrait of the upper class surrounded with small but 
      nonetheless tell-tale signs of unrest.</p>
