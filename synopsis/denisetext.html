    <p class="orange">Made for Denise<br>
      1978, 5 minutes</p>
    <p class="blacktext">Made for Denise, along with Polaroid Cocaine and 
      Brooding Angles (made for R.L.), is the closest thing Auder has produced 
      to music videos. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">Made For Denise features the music of Philip Glass 
      whose acquaintance Auder made in the early 1970s while producing work 
      for The Kitchen. Through the use of original and appropriated video 
      footage, Auder translates a religious sermon into an expression of love 
      for this strikingly beautiful woman. This lovers tale opens with a photograph 
      of Denise that is alternately caressed and crushed in the palm of her 
      lover's hand; a gesture oscillating between affection and an obsessive 
      and irrational desire for possession. </p>
    <p class="blacktext">Auder builds on the increasing grandeur of the sermon's 
      metaphors, extending them into the realm of destruction. The mood undergoes 
      a violent shift as what was once fruit and flowers abruptly  gives way 
      to catastrophe.</p>
